- This is a repo that I made in response to
  [this question on Bioinformatics Stack Exchange - What is the fastest way to get the reverse complement of a DNA sequence in python?](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/3583)
- To run this test on your own machine, navigate to this directory and execute `python reverse_complement_tests.py`
- Feel free to contribute if you have other ideas. Exceedingly
  convoluted or bad implementations for fun are also welcome.
